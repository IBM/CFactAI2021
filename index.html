                  Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have the potential to aid in situations where humans can benefit from augmented decision-making. 
                  This is particularly important in the healthcare domain as an overabundance of information within electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in a need for automated systems to mitigate the cognitive burden on physicians utilizing todayâ€™s EHR systems. 
                  Since the early 2000s, community challenges, or shared tasks, have pushed development of NLP systems and tested the state-of-the-art for applications of these technologies in a variety of increasingly more complex challenge tasks in the clinical domain. 
                  In addition to use cases in the clinical setting, secondary uses of EHR data, such as clinical trial cohort selection, insurance underwriting, and adverse drug event reporting are also in need of such information extraction and text summarization applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Significant gaps remain between existing NLP shared tasks and systems integrated into the workflow of real clinical applications and real-world use cases\(^{1}\).
                  To help bridge these gaps, we propose a new shared task to extract evidence of clinical factors from clinical notes for a given medical condition, 
                  where a clinical factor is defined as information on the screening, diagnosis, or management of the condition according to its relevant clinical practice guidelines.  
                  The main differentiators of this task are, 
                  <ul">
                    <li>the clinical factors are contextualized by the given guidelines</li>
                    <li>the evaluation setup favors systems that can generalize to conditions and guidelines outside of the training data</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                  Systems performing well in this task have the potential to improve downstream healthcare applications where context-awareness and generalizability are important.

                  <h2>Track 1: Span Extraction</h2>
                  The first track is extraction of span corresponding to each evidence \(e_{ijk}\) for each clinical factor \(f_{ij}\).
                  <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Span-level</b>:
                    For each clinical factor \(f_{ij}\) and note \(n_{k}\), participant systems will be asked to identify the evidence \(e_{ijk}\) corresponding to the clinical factor. Average ROUGE score will be used for the comparison of system performance. 
                  </li>
                    <li><b>Sentence-level</b>:
                      For each clinical factor \(f_{ij}\) and note \(n_{k}\), participant systems will be asked to identify the index of the sentence in which the evidence \(e_{ijk}\) corresponding to the clinical factor appears. 
                      We will perform sentence segmentation and release the indices and offsets as part of the ground truth to avoid ambiguity. The task is set up in such a way that there is no inter-sentential reasoning needed, 
                      meaning evidences are fully contained within the span of the sentence. 
                      Systems will be compared based on both macro and micro-averaged f-measure with the precision being the ratio of sentences found by the system that are correct (meaning they contain the correct evidence \(e_{ijk}\)) and 
                      the recall being the ratio of sentences present in the ground truth that are found by the system. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="heading">
                  <h2>Track 2: Document-level Summary</h2>
                  Here, instead of identifying specific evidence(s) \(e_{ijk}\) for a clinical factor \(f_{ij}\) for note \(k\), participant systems will be asked to provide assertions "present (1) / absent (0) / negated (-1)" for each clinical factor \(f_{ij}\) at the note level. 
                  For example, consider the following setting:
                  <ul>
                    <li>One of the clinical factors is \(\texttt{A1C > 6.5%}\)</li>
                    <li>A span of text within the clinical note contains the following string: \(\texttt{...His last hemoglobin A1C drawn at the end of December is 11.9. ...}\)</li>
                  </ul>
                  The expected answer is "present (1)".
                  Let us say that some condition \(d_{i}\) has 5 clinical factors \(f_{i1,...,i5}\). If evidences for a subset say, \(1^{st}\) and \(3^{rd}\) clinical factors are present and \(4^{th}\) clinical factor is refuted in the note \(n_{k}\) for condition \(d_{i}\) .
                  The ground truth for combination \(d_{i}\)-\(n_{k}\) would look like {1, 0, 1, -1, 0}. 
                  If there are partial or contradicting evidences within the clinical note, systems would need to compute the "summary" assertion for the entire note for \(f_{ij}\). 
                  This requires inter-sentential reasoning.
                  <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
                  Systems will be compared based on both macro and micro-averaged f-measure with the precision being the ratio of clinical notes found by the system that are correct (meaning that the assertion on clinical factor \(f_{ij}\) matches the ground truth) and 
                  the recall being the ratio of clinical notes present in the ground truth that are found by the system.

                      a single-center dataset comprised of de-identified data relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital.

                      and unstructured notes charted by care providers. The database has been extensively used to support applications ranging from academic research, quality improvement initiatives, 
                      and predictive modeling. The annotations are created by 6 physicians using 1,500 admission notes and discharge summaries selected from MIMIC-III.

                      A candidate list of clinical factors for each clinical condition was compiled by a review of clinical guidelines authored by a medical society or association 
                      (e.g., American College of Cardiology) and a point of care clinical knowledge resource (e.g., UpToDate by Wolters Kluwer). Clinical factors were considered across 
                      the spectrum of evaluation and management, and could encompass specific symptoms, narrative histories, or physical exam findings. 
                      This list of candidate clinical factors was refined by eliminating any clinical factor represented by a structured data field within an EMR (e.g., demographic information, 
                      problems lists, medication orders, laboratory results). The final list of clinical factors defined are represented as unstructured text or spans of text within the clinical notes.
                      Two of the conditions and a subset of clinical factors identified for this challenge task are represented in the following table
